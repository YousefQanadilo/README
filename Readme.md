# üëã Hey, I‚Äôm Yousef Qanadilo

I'm a robotics + AI enthusiast and currently pursing a CS in AI and Robotics. I am passionate about building intelligent systems that can learn, move, and adapt. From low-level control to high-level reasoning, I love exploring the full stack of mobile robotics and machine learning.

## üß† What I Work On

- ü§ñ **Mobile Robotics** ‚Äì Motion planning, inverse kinematics, and closed-form control strategies for 6DOF+ manipulators.
- üß¨ **AI & Machine Learning** ‚Äì Backpropagation, gradient descent, optimizers, adversarial search, and constraint satisfaction problems.
- üß∞ **Software Systems** ‚Äì Scalable back-end systems using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), containerized with Docker and orchestrated with ROS2.
